Input File Setup
-------------------

    | Treatment and control input fastq[.gz] files are supplied separately, with 
      one control sample (after merging) per treatment group. These are 
      supplied to :param:`treat_fastqs` and :param:`ctrl_fastqs`, respectively.
    |
    | Alterantively, multiple groups
      of samples can be setup with specific, differing control samples using
      :param:`sample_groups`. For more details, see 
      :ref:`Task Setup`.
